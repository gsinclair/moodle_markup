[Topic 16]

[Description]

Coordinate geometry is a large topic. The programme is divided into three parts:
 * 16a: distance, midpoint, gradient diagrams; number plane graphs
 * 16b: distance, midpoint, gradient formulas; y = mx + b
 * 16c: further equations of a line; regions

Note: there is a lot of detail in the "y = mx + b" area: sketching; finding
equations; parallel and perpendicular lines; general form; and more.

{highlight:Only 16a and 16b were assessed in Task 2 on 17 March 2010.}

<y = mx + b interactive> 5.23 U (ggb) file:interactive.ggb
  Manipulate the values of _m_ and _b_ in this GeoGebra file, and see the effect
  they have on the graph.

<Further equations of straight lines> 5.3 F,PS (pdf) file:^Further
  Textbook exercise with more challenging questions on finding the equations of
  straight lines.

<Graphing straight line families> 5.23 U (gsp) file:^Graphing
  A GSP file encouraging you to think about the relationship between a linear
  equation and the corresponding graph. Essentially a teaching resource, but
  useful for independent study. {warn:Only works if you have Geometers Sketchpad
  installed.}

<Gradient product of perpendicular lines> 5.23 U (gsp) file:^Gradient
  Explore the relationship between the gradients of two lines when they become
  perpendicular. {warn:Only works if you have Geometers Sketchpad installed.}
