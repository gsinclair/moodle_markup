moodle_markup README

I create webpages in Moodle as part of my job.  Aspects of doing this are
extremely annoying.  This project allows me to turn plain text files (with
certain layout and formatting rules observed) into HTML that I can copy into
Moodle (or insert directly into the database).

It's geared specifically at the types of pages I create, and is unlikely to
interest anyone else directly.
